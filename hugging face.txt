Hello,
I am an aspiring software engineer with a passion for open-source development and machine learning. I love the idea of working on impactful projects in a fast-paced environment. My love for technology has paved my career thus far and I have had the opportunity to grow as a software engineer through internships at Amazon, NCR, and Jewelers Mutual.
I came across Hugging Face when looking into emerging AI companies and I strongly aligned with the open-source philosophy that the company has. I believe I would be a good fit and more importantly, really enjoy working at a company that approaches problems in the way hugging face does.


I am applying to work at Hugging Face because I have a strong interest in Machine Learning. I want to contribute to paving the way for people to build ML-based projects with ease and I believe I can do that in the most impactful way at Hugging Face. I am a strong believer in open-source technology as well, which is why I appreciate how Hugging Face is developing its tools.
If hired, the team can expect me to be a fast learner and I would be passionate to take on new challenges in the space. I have accumulated research experience in the field of Reinforcement Learning, and LLMs, and have developed my Software Engineering skills through internships at Amazon, NCR, and Jewelers Mutual. I have also taught myself about the Machine Learning space through multiple personal projects.

I have worked on multiple projects but the ones that I am proud of the most are -
1. Developed a Real-time sign language translator for video calling. (Hosted workshop on this at university)
2. Contributed to CI/CD pipeline for AWS Amplify CLI. (Open source project hosted by AWS)
3. Developed a contactless healthcare platform for my community during the beginning of the pandemic. (Winner of Square, now Block, small business hackathon)
4. Built OCR engine to identify car number plates. (Hosted at university to introduce freshmen to Machine Learning)
